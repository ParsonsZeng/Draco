# DRACO: Byzantine-resilient Distributed Training via Redundant Gradients
This repository contains source code for Draco, a scalable framework for robust distributed training that uses ideas from coding theory. Please check [https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09877](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09877) for detailed information about this project.

## Overview:
Draco is a scalable framework for robust distributed training that uses ideasfrom coding theory. In Draco, compute nodes evaluate redundant gradients that are then used by the parameter server (PS) to eliminate the effects of adversarial updates.

In Draco, each compute node processes *rB/P* gradients and sends a linear combination of those to the PS. This means that Draco incurs a computational redundancy ratio of *r*. Upon receiving the *P* gradient sums, the PS uses a “decoding” function to remove the effect of the adversarial nodes and reconstruct the original desired sum of the B gradients. With redundancy ratio *r*, we show that Draco can tolerate up to *(r − 1)/2* adversaries, which is information theoretically tight. 

## Depdendencies:
Tested stable depdencises:
* python 2.7 (Anaconda)
* PyTorch 0.3.0 (*please note that, we're moving to PyTorch 0.4.0, and 1.0.x*)
* MPI4Py 0.3.0
* python-blosc 1.5.0

## Cluster Setup:
For running on distributed cluster, the first thing you need do is to launch AWS EC2 instances.
### Launching Instances:
[This script](https://github.com/hwang595/ps_pytorch/blob/master/tools/pytorch_ec2.py) helps you to launch EC2 instances automatically, but before running this script, you should follow [the instruction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) to setup AWS CLI on your local machine.
After that, please edit this part in `./tools/pytorch_ec2.py`
``` python
cfg = Cfg({
    "name" : "PS_PYTORCH",      # Unique name for this specific configuration
    "key_name": "NameOfKeyFile",          # Necessary to ssh into created instances
    # Cluster topology
    "n_masters" : 1,                      # Should always be 1
    "n_workers" : 8,
    "num_replicas_to_aggregate" : "8", # deprecated, not necessary
    "method" : "spot",
    # Region speficiation
    "region" : "us-west-2",
    "availability_zone" : "us-west-2b",
    # Machine type - instance type configuration.
    "master_type" : "m4.2xlarge",
    "worker_type" : "m4.2xlarge",
    # please only use this AMI for pytorch
    "image_id": "ami-xxxxxxxx",            # id of AMI
    # Launch specifications
    "spot_price" : "0.15",                 # Has to be a string
    # SSH configuration
    "ssh_username" : "ubuntu",            # For sshing. E.G: ssh ssh_username@hostname
    "path_to_keyfile" : "/dir/to/NameOfKeyFile.pem",

    # NFS configuration
    # To set up these values, go to Services > ElasticFileSystem > Create new filesystem, and follow the directions.
    #"nfs_ip_address" : "172.31.3.173",         # us-west-2c
    #"nfs_ip_address" : "172.31.35.0",          # us-west-2a
    "nfs_ip_address" : "172.31.14.225",          # us-west-2b
    "nfs_mount_point" : "/home/ubuntu/shared",       # NFS base dir
```
For setting everything up on EC2 cluster, the easiest way is to setup one machine and create an AMI. Then use the AMI id for `image_id` in `pytorch_ec2.py`. Then, launch EC2 instances by running
```
python ./tools/pytorch_ec2.py launch
```
After all launched instances are ready (this may take a while), getting private ips of instances by
```
python ./tools/pytorch_ec2.py get_hosts
```
this will write ips into a file named `hosts_address`, which looks like
```
172.31.16.226 (${PS_IP})
172.31.27.245
172.31.29.131
172.31.18.108
172.31.18.174
172.31.17.228
172.31.16.25
172.31.30.61
172.31.29.30
```
After generating the `hosts_address` of all EC2 instances, running the following command will copy your keyfile to the parameter server (PS) instance whose address is always the first one in `hosts_address`. `local_script.sh` will also do some basic configurations e.g. clone this git repo
```
bash ./tool/local_script.sh ${PS_IP}
```
### SSH related:
At this stage, you should ssh to the PS instance and all operation should happen on PS. In PS setting, PS should be able to ssh to any compute node, [this part](https://github.com/hwang595/ps_pytorch/blob/master/tools/remote_script.sh#L8-L22) dose the job for you by running (after ssh to the PS)
```
bash ./tools/remote_script.sh
```

## Prepare Datasets
We currently support [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [Cifar10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) datasets. Download, split, and transform datasets by (and `./tools/remote_script.sh` dose this for you)
```
bash ./src/data_prepare.sh
```
